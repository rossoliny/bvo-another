# Welcome  
  
  Hello, my name is *[Rossoliny](https://github.com/rossoliny)* and this is a *__NEW__* dev page of Bleach vs One Piece Another map.
  
  Many years ago Kuragane created the original BvO map, but then he abandoned it and Unryze continued development and we got BvO Another 1.1a that is considered to most balanced and bugfree version of all.  
  Now Unryze also seem to lose interest to this map so I decided to continue.

# Contribution
Rossoliny's BvO is open source.  

The original BvO from Kurogane was protected in many ways so it is not possible for this map to be completely open souece. However, I myself will not try to add any kinds of protection to this map and all changes that *__I make__* will be open source. So, you can freely download this repository and explore the sources.  

Or you can contribute to this project to help me with development.
